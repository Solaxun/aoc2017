My lack of math skills saved me from the same folly since I basically had constructed the grid already in part one, which made part two much simpler."

The instructions turned out to be fast enough without trying to find a patterm or optimizing the sequence by some form of pre-processing, but I wouldn't be surprised if, like last year, later puzzles build on the sequence and make it prohitively slow without some optmizations.  \n",

I do wonder how I'll approach this in a more functional style, since I'm trying to do all of these problems in Clojure once I've finished them in Python first.  Typically whenever I think `while` in an imperative language, I think `reduce` in a functional language, so I'll probably start there."

    "I started down the path of a recursive solution, because that seemed the most natural to me at the time.  Just make the updates to the list, add the result to the `seen` set, and recur with an incremented count.  Except I forgot about the 1,000 depth recursion limit in Python.  I guess this is what happens when you spend too much time in Clojure lately.  I burned a good 20 minutes trying to manually increase the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(n)` and kept getting an infuriating error `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable`.  I eventually gave up since this isn't the documented behavior and I couldn't figure out why it was failing.  In any event, I probably should not treat an iterative problem with a recursive solution in a language without tail call optmization, so I just converted the solution to a nested `while` loop instead.\n",

Something about this solution rubs me the wrong way, it doesn't feel that elegant but it gets the job done.  I think it's the nested while loops that are giving me that feeling.  Anyhow - when I'm trying to solve these fast I focus on just getting something working first, making it pretty comes later.
