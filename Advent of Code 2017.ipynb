I guess I got lucky in the way I implemented part one - my guess is alot of people found a nice analytical solution to part one and then had to scrap and start from nothing for part two.  My lack of math skills saved me from the same folly since I basically had constructed the grid already in part one, which made part two much simpler."

Just make the updates to the list, add the result to the `seen` set, and recur with an incremented count.  Except I forgot about the 1,000 depth recursion limit in Python.

I burned a good 20 minutes trying to manually increase the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(n)` and kept getting an infuriating error `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable`.  I eventually gave up since this isn't the documented behavior and I couldn't figure out why it was failing.

I'm including the original solution to part one (I could easily extend this for part two - at least I think I could) to keep myself honest, since I had a pretty big hint to arrive at the below."
